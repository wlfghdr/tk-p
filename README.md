## 🎮 Game Overview

**Timekiller** challenges players to quickly identify matching tiles under time pressure. The game features two distinct modes (Colors and Emojis) and progressively increases difficulty through higher levels.

### Game Objective

Find and tap the tile where the **text content matches the background**:
- **Colors Mode**: The text "Blue" must be on a blue tile
- **Emojis Mode**: The text "Ghost" must be next to a 👻 emoji

## ✨ Features

#### 🎨 Colors Mode

#### 😀 Emojis Mode
- **Standard**: 16 emojis (randomly mixed each game)
- **Pro Mode**: 64 emojis (randomly mixed each game)

- **Pro Mode Bonus**: 1.5× (50% more points)

**Formula**:
```
Final Score = Base Points × Level Multiplier × Emoji Bonus × Pro Bonus
```

**Point Awards**:
